Team member roles for Week 1
Jack: X Role
Tajah: Triangle
Ashley: Circle
Thomas: Square Role

Despite assigning specific roles for week one we found it was much more productive for all members to be actively involved in each process for the first week.  We all chipped in during the data set selection, picking of technologies used, and construction of the machine learning model mockup.
